### Notes:
- This README assumes a typical React project setup (e.g., created with Create React App). If the project uses a different setup (like Vite, Next.js, or custom configurations), you’ll need to adjust the instructions accordingly.
- Replace placeholders (e.g., additional features, specific technologies, or folder structure) with details from the actual project if you have access to it.
- If the project has specific requirements (e.g., environment variables, API keys, or a backend), add those details under the "Installation" or "Usage" sections.
